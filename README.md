Hill Climber Game in Unity
This is a simple 2D Hill Climber game developed using Unity. The objective of the game is to drive the car across various terrains without running out of momentum or crashing. The game does not have a fuel depletion mechanic like the original Hill Climber, allowing players to focus on navigating challenging slopes and obstacles without worrying about fuel levels.

Features:
Simple Controls:
Use arrow keys to control the car's movement (forward, backward, etc.).
Navigate up and down slopes while maintaining balance and speed.

Terrain Generation: Randomized or manually designed terrain to keep gameplay engaging and challenging.

Distance Tracker: The game displays the distance covered by the car.

Game Over Conditions:
The game ends if the car flips over or crashes.

Project Setup:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Press the "Play" button in the Unity Editor to start playing.
   
Future Improvements:
1. Adding a fuel mechanic to increase challenge and strategy.
2. Implementing multiple levels with different difficulty settings.
3. Adding various vehicles and upgrade options.
